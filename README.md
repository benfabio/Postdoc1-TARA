### TARA Oceans  Zooplankton imaging (Zooscan) dataset
R scripts developed for analyzing the zooplankton imaging dataset of Tara Oceans during my first (and short) postdoctoral contract at UMR7093-LOV.

Here, I deposit the main scripts developed during my contract (2017) and used to collect, curate, prepare, model and analyze data under the R coding environment.
I selected the R scripts that are key to reproduce the results published in:
- Brandao, M., Benedetti, F., et al. (submitted to Scientific Reports)

I acknowledge these R scripts are not commented in the most detailed fashion.
