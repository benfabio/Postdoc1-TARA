### TARA Oceans  Zooplankton imaging (Zooscan) dataset
R scripts for analyzing the zooplankton imaging dataset of Tara Oceans during my postdoctoral contract at UMR7093-LOV, funded by the "Parc Naturel Marin de la Mer d'Iroise" (PNMIR), and continued during my postdoc at ETH Zürich (see OVERSEE repository).

Here, I deposit the main R scripts developed during my contract and used to curate, prepare, model and analyze various types of data under the R coding environment.
These R scripts allow to reproduce the results published in Brandāo, M., Benedetti, F., et al. (2021), available at: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94615-5 

I acknowledge these R scripts are not commented in the most detailed fashion. I did not know how to use Git and GitHub backed then. Feel free to contact me at: fabio.benedetti@usys.ethz.ch or fabio.benedetti@unibe.ch if you need further information.
