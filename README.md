### TARA Oceans  Zooplankton imaging (Zooscan) dataset
R scripts for analyzing the zooplankton imaging dataset of Tara Oceans during my postdoctoral contract at UMR7093-LOV, funded by the "Parc Naturel Marin de la Mer d'Iroise" (PNMIR), and continued during my postdoc at ETH Zürich (see OVERSEE repository).

Here, I deposit the main scripts developed during my contract (2017) and used to curate, prepare, model and analyze various types of data under the R coding environment.
I selected the R scripts that are key to reproduce the results published in:
- Brandāo, M., Benedetti, F., et al. (submitted to Scientific Reports)

I acknowledge these R scripts are not commented in the most detailed fashion.
